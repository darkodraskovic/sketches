# Generative Art Weekly

This Eclipse based project uses **Processing** java libraries to

  * create (idealy) a weekly Processing generative art sketch.
  * store, *via* sketches, various generative art ideas to be used as
    starting points for more elaborated sketches
  * set up experiments in procedural generation.
    
The generative art and procedural generation works are mostly in 2D.
