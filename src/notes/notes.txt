- use all shapes: ELLIPSE, RECT, ARC, TRIANGLE, QUAD
	- see https://processing.org/reference/createShape_.html
- use shape compositions as patterns
	- include LINE
	- use diff shape dirs like hor, ver, diag
	- use parallel and orthogonal shape distros
- partition canvas according to some principle and put patterns of shape (patterns) in partitions
	- use BSP
	- use trig or quadratic func to gen inc/dec hor/ver area strips
